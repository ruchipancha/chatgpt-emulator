assistant,"Amy sat in the waiting room, tapping her foot anxiously. This was her fifth chance to get it right, and she couldn't afford to mess it up again. She had failed so many times before, but she had to keep trying.The door finally opened and a stern-looking woman beckoned her inside. Amy followed her into a small room and sat down at the table. The woman began to ask her questions, and Amy did her best to answer them truthfully. She didn't want to give the wrong impression or say something that would make her lose this chance. As the interview went on, Amy's nerves began to get the best of her. She stumbled over her words and lost her train of thought. The woman looked unimpressed and made a note on her clipboard. After what felt like an eternity, the interview was over. Amy left the room feeling defeated. She had tried so hard, but it didn't seem to be enough. As she walked out of the building, she saw a man sitting on the sidewalk with a cardboard sign that read, 'Anything helps.' Amy dug into her pocket and pulled out a few dollars. As she handed them to the man, she noticed something strange. He had a tattoo on his wrist that looked familiar. It was the same one she had. Amy's heart skipped a beat. She turned to the man and asked, 'How did you get that tattoo?' The man looked up at her and smiled. 'I got it when I was trying to turn my life around. It's a symbol of hope.' Amy felt a glimmer of hope herself. Maybe this wasn't the end of the road. Maybe she still had a chance to get it right."

assistant,"Amy sat in the waiting room, nervously biting her nails. She really needed this job, not just for the money, but because her parents were starting to ask when she was going to move out of their basement. The door finally opened and the woman called her in, looking at her with a face that said 'I'm not impressed, but you might as well come in anyway.' Amy sat down, trying to appear confident and hoping she didn't have any spinach in her teeth. The woman began asking her questions and Amy was doing surprisingly well, until she accidentally referred to her previous boss as a ""tosser"" instead of just saying he was difficult to work with. The woman raised an eyebrow but didn't say anything. As the interview went on, Amy's nerves got the best of her and she started to talk faster and faster until she was practically speaking in tongues. The woman looked confused and made a note on her clipboard. Finally, the painful experience was over and Amy left the room feeling like she had just left an awkward first date. As she walked out of the building, she saw a man sitting on the sidewalk with a cardboard sign that read, 'Will work for food, or a hug.' Amy rolled her eyes at the hug part, but dug into her pocket and pulled out a few dollars. As she handed them to the man, she noticed something strange. He had a tattoo on his wrist that looked familiar. It was the same one she had. ""Wait a minute,"" she said, ""how'd you get that tattoo?"" The man looked up at her and said, ""Oh this? It's my lucky charm. I got it after my interview with Satan got me this sweet position here on earth."" Amy wasn't sure if he was joking or not, but she laughed anyway. She left feeling like things maybe weren't so bad after all."
